<p>
    In this tutorial, written by D. Eisenbud and M. Stillman,
    we introduce a number
    of basic operations using Gröbner bases, and
    at the same time become familiar with a range
    of useful Macaulay2 constructs. The sections are:

</p>

    <h4>A. First Steps; example with a monomial curve</h4>
<p>
    To compute the Gröbner basis of an ideal
    $(x^2y,xy^2+x^3)$ in the polynomial ring in
    four variables we proceed as follows:
</p>
<p>
    Our favorite field
</p>
<p><code>KK = ZZ/31991</code></p>
<p>
    The polynomial ring
</p>
<p><code>R = KK[x,y,z,w]</code></p>
<p>
    and the ideal
</p>
<p><code>I = ideal(x^2*y,x*y^2+x^3)</code></p>
<p>
    now the punch line:
</p>
<p><code>J = groebnerBasis I</code></p>
<p>
    From this we can for example compute the
    codimension, dimension,
    degree, and the whole Hilbert
    function and polynomial.  
    This will be more fun if we work with an
    example having some meaning.  We choose
    to work with the ideal defining the
    rational quartic curve in ${\PP}^3$ given
    parametrically in an affine representation
    by 
    $$t \mapsto{} (t,t^3,t^4).$$
    (The reader who doesn't understand this
    terminology may ignore it for the moment,
    and treat the ideal given below as a 
    gift from the gods... .)
    We obtain the ideal by first making the 
    polynomial ring in 4 variables (the
    homogeneous coordinate ring of ${\PP}^3$)
</p>
<p><code>R = KK[a..d]</code></p>
<p>
    and then using a function "monomialCurveIdeal", which we shall
    treat for now as a black box
</p>
<p><code>I = monomialCurveIdeal(R,{1,3,4})</code></p>
<p>
    $I$ is an ideal, and the codimension of its support
    is 2, while its dimension is 2:
</p>
<p><code>codim I</code></p>
<p><code>dim I</code></p>
<p>
    This is the codimension of $R/I$ in $R$ 
    and the dimension of $R/I$.  We could work with
    the module $R/I$ as well.
    Precision requires writing $R^1$ instead
    of $R$ ($R$ is a ring, and $R^1$ is
    the free module of rank 1 over it)
</p>
<p><code>codim (R^1/(I*R^1))</code></p>
<p>
    We could also extract the generators of
    $I$ (as a matrix) and take the cokernel to
    get the same thing:
</p>
<p><code>M = coker gens I</code></p>
<p><code>codim M</code></p>
<p><code>dim M</code></p>
<p>
    And similarly for the degree:
</p>
<p><code>degree I</code></p>
<p><code>degree M</code></p>
<p>
    As one might expect, the degree of the quartic
    is 4.
</p>
<p>
    The Hilbert polynomial is obtained by
</p>
<p><code>hilbertPolynomial M</code></p>
<p>
    The term ${\PP}^i$ represents the Hilbert polynomial of
    projective $i$-space.  This formula tells
    us that the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is
    $H(m) = 4(m+1) - 3 = 4m + 1$.  Thus the degree
    is four, the dimension of the projective variety
    which is the support of $M$ is 1 (and so the affine
    dimension is 2),
    and that the (arithmetic) genus is 0 (1 minus the
    constant term, for curves).
</p>
<p>
    The Hilbert series of $M$ (the generating function
    for the dimensions of the graded pieces of $M$) is
</p>
<p><code>hilbertSeries M</code></p>
<p>
    The indeterminate in this expression is \(T\).
</p>
<p>
    Another way to get information about
    the module $M$ is to see its free resolution
</p>
<p><code>Mres = res M</code></p>
<p>
    To get more precise information about \({\tt Mres}\),
    we could do
</p>
<p><code>betti Mres</code></p>
<p>
    The display is chosen for compactness:
    the first line gives the total betti 
    numbers, the same information given when
    we type the resolution.  The remaining
    lines express the degrees of each of the
    generators of the free modules in the
    resolution.  The $j$th column after the colons
    gives the degrees of generators of the
    $j$th module(counting from $0$); 
    an $n$ in the $j$th column in the
    row headed by $d$: means that the $j$th
    free module has $n$ generators of degree
    $n+j$.  Thus for example in our case, the
    generator of the third (last) free module in the
    resolution has degree $3+2=5$.
</p>

<div>
    <h4>B. Random regular sequences</h4>
<p>
    An interesting and illustrative open problem
    is to understand the initial ideal (and 
    the Gröbner basis) of a "generic"
    regular sequence (i.e. an ideal generated
    by a small number of random homogeneous polynomials).
    To study a very simple case
    we take a matrix of 2 random forms 
    in a polynomial ring in
    3 variables:
</p>
<p><code>R = KK[x,y,z]</code></p>
<p><code>F = random(R^1, R^{-2,-3})</code></p>
<p>
    makes $F$ into a $1 \times 2$ matrix whose elements
    have degrees $2,3$ (that is, $F$ is a random map
    to the free module $R^1$, which has its one
    generator in the (default) degree, $0$, from
    the free module with generators in the listed
    degrees, $\{2,3\}$).  We now can compute
</p>
<p><code>GB = groebnerBasis F</code></p>
<p><code>LT = leadTerm GB</code></p>
<p><code>betti LT</code></p>
<p>
    shows that there are Gröbner basis elements
    of degrees 2,3, and 4.  This result is
    dependent on the monomial order in the ring $R$;
    for example we could take the lexicographic
    order
</p>
<p><code>R = KK[x,y,z, MonomialOrder => Lex]</code></p>
<p>
    (do "help MonomialOrder" for other possibilities).
    We get 
</p>
<p><code>F = random(R^1, R^{-2,-3})</code></p>
<p><code>GB = gens gb F</code></p>
<p><code>LT = leadTerm gens gb F</code></p>
<p><code>betti LT</code></p>
<p>
    and there are Gröbner basis elements of degrees 
    $2,3,4,5,6.$
</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>C. Division With Remainder</h4>
<p>
    A major application of Gröbner bases is
    to decide whether an element is in a given
    ideal, and whether two elements reduce to
    the same thing modulo an ideal.  For
    example, everyone knows that the trace
    of a nilpotent matrix is 0. We can produce
    an ideal $I$ that defines the variety $X$ of 
    nilpotent $3 \times 3$ matrices by taking the cube
    of a generic matrix and setting the entries
    equal to zero.  Here's how:
</p>
<p><code>R = KK[a..i]</code></p>
<p><code>M = genericMatrix(R,a,3,3)</code></p>
<p><code>N = M^3</code></p>
<p><code>I = flatten N</code></p>
<p>
    (actually this produces a 1 x 9 matrix of
    of forms, not the ideal: "J = ideal I";
    the matrix will be more useful to us).
    But the trace is not in $I$!  This is obvious
    from the fact that the trace has degree $1$,
    but the polynomials in $I$ are of degree $3$.
    We could also check by division with
    remainder:
</p>
<p><code>Tr = trace M </code></p>
<p><code>Tr //I  -- the quotient, which is 0</code></p>
<p><code>Tr % I  -- the remainder, which is Tr again</code></p>
<p>
    (Here $Tr$ is an element of $R$, not a matrix.
    We could do the same thing with a $1 \times 1$ matrix
    with $Tr$ as its element.)
    This is of course because the entries of $I$ do
    NOT
    generate the ideal of all forms 
    vanishing on $X$ -- this we may find with
</p>
<p><code>J = radical ideal I;</code></p>
<p><code>netList J_*</code></p>
<p>
    that the radical is generated by
    the trace, the determinant, and the sum of 
    the principal $2 \times 2$ minors, that is, by the
    coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.
    In particular, we can try the powers of the
    trace:
</p>
<p><code>Tr^2 % I</code></p>
<p><code>Tr^3 % I</code></p>
<p><code>Tr^4 % I</code></p>
<p><code>Tr^5 % I</code></p>
<p><code>Tr^6 % I</code></p>
<p><code>Tr^7 % I</code></p>
<p>
    The seventh power is the first one in the 
    ideal!  (Bernard Mourrain has worked out a
    formula for which power in general.)
    In this case
</p>
<p><code>Tr^6 // I</code></p>
<p>
    is not 0.  It is a matrix that makes the
    following true:
</p>
<p><code>Tr^6 == I * (Tr^6 // I) + (Tr^6 % I)</code></p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>D. Elimination Theory</h4>
<p>
    Consider the problem of projecting the
    twisted cubic, a curve in ${\PP}^3$ defined
    by the three $2 \times 2$ minors of a certain
    $2 \times 3$ matrix into the plane.  
    Such problems can be solved in a very 
    simple and direct way using Gröbner bases.
    The technique lends itself to many extensions,
    and in its developed form can be used to find
    the closure of the image of any map of 
    affine varieties.  
</p>
<p>
    In this section we shall first give a 
    simple direct treatment of the problem above,
    and then show how to use Macaulay2's 
    general tool to solve the problem.
    We first
    clear the earlier meaning of $x$ to make it
    into a subscripted variable
</p>
<p><code>x = global x</code></p>
<p>
    and then set
</p>
<p><code>R = KK[x_0..x_3] </code></p>
<p>
    the homogeneous coordinate ring of ${\PP}^3$
    and
</p>
<p><code>M = map(R^2, 3, (i,j)->x_(i+j))</code></p>
<p><code>I = gens minors(2,M)</code></p>
<p>
    a matrix whose image is 
    the ideal of the twisted cubic.
    As projection center we
    take the point defined by
</p>
<p><code>pideal = ideal(x_0+x_3, x_1, x_2)</code></p>
<p>
    To find the image we must intersect the ideal
    $I$ with the subring generated by the 
    generators of "pideal".  We make a change of
    variable so that these generators become
    the last three variables in the ring; that
    is, we write the ring as $KK[y_0..y_3]$
    where 
    $$y_0 = x_0, y_1 = x_1, y_2 = x_2, y_3 = x_0+x_3$$
    and thus
    $x_3 = y_3-y_0$, etc. 
    We want the new ring to have an elimination
    order for the first variable.
</p>
<p><code>y = global y</code></p>
<p><code>S = KK[y_0..y_3,MonomialOrder => Eliminate 1]</code></p>
<p>
    Here is one way to make the substitution
</p>
<p><code>I1 = substitute(I, matrix{{y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3-y_0}})</code></p>
<p>
    The elimination of 1 variable from the 
    matrix of Gröbner basis elements proceeds
    as follows:
</p>
<p><code>J = selectInSubring(1,gens gb I1)</code></p>
<p>
    and gives (a matrix with element)
    the cubic equation of a rational
    curve with one double point in the plane.
    However, we are still in a ring with 4 
    variables, so if we really want a plane
    curve (and not the cone over one) we must
    move to yet another ring:
</p>
<p><code>S1 = KK[y_1..y_3]</code></p>
<p><code>J1 = substitute(J, S1)</code></p>
<p>
    This time we didn't have to give so much
    detail to the "substitute" command because of 
    the coincidence of the names of the variables.
</p>
<p>
    Having shown the primitive method, we
    now show a much more flexible and transparent
    one:  we set up a ring map from the polynomial
    ring in $3$ variables (representing the plane)
    to $R/I$, taking the variables $y$ to the three
    linear forms that define the projection 
    center.  Then we just take the kernel of
    this map!  (Under the hood, 
    Macaulay2 is doing a more refined version
    of the same computation as before.)
    Here is the ring map
</p>
<p><code>Rbar = R/(ideal I)</code></p>
<p><code>f = map(Rbar, S1, matrix(Rbar,{{x_0+x_3, x_1,x_2}}))</code></p>
<p>
    and the desired ideal
</p>
<p><code>J1 = ker f</code></p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>E. Quotients and saturation</h4>
<p>
    Another typical application of 
    Gröbner bases and syzygies is to the
    computation of ideal quotients and 
    saturations.  Again we give an easy example
    that we can treat directly, and then 
    introduce the tool used in \(\mac\) to 
    treat the general case.
</p>
<p>
    If $I$ and $J$ are ideals in a ring $R$, we define
    $(I:J)$, the ideal quotient, by 
    $$(I:J) = \{f \in R \mid fJ \subset I\}.$$
</p>
<p>
    In our first examples we consider 
    the case where $J$ is 
    generated by a single element $g$.
    This arises in practice, for example, in the
    problem of homogenizing an ideal.  Suppose
    we consider the affine space curve
    parametrized by
    $t \mapsto{} (t,t^2,t^3)$.  The ideal of polynomials
    vanishing on the curve is easily seen to
    be $(b-a^2, c-a^3)$ (where we have taken
    $a,b,c$ as the coordinates of affine space).
    To find the projective closure of the curve
    in ${\PP}^3$, we must homogenize these equations 
    with respect to a new variable d, getting
    $db-a^2, d^2c-a^3$.  But these forms do NOT
    define the projective closure! In general,
    homogenizing the generators of the ideal $I$ of
    an affine variety one gets an ideal $I_1$ that
    defines the projective closure UP TO
    a component supported on the hyperplane
    at infinity (the hyperplane $d=0$).  To see
    the ideal of the closure we must remove
    any such components, for example by
    replacing $I_1$ by the union $I_2$ of all the
    ideals $(I_1:d^n)$, where $n$ ranges over positive
    integers.  This is not so hard as it seems:
    First of all, we can successively compute
    the increasing sequence of ideals
    $(I_1:d), (I_1:d^2), \ldots $ until we get two 
    that are the same; all succeeding ones
    will be equal, so we have found the union.
    A second method involves a special property
    of the reverse lex order, and is much more
    efficient in this case.  We shall illustrate
    both. First we set up the example above:
</p>
<p><code>R = KK[a,b,c,d]</code></p>
<p><code>I1 = ideal(d*b-a^2, d^2*c-a^3)</code></p>
<p>
    How to compute the ideal quotient:
    If $I$ is generated by $f_1,\ldots,f_n$, we see that
    $s\in (I:g)$ iff there are ring elements 
    $r_i$ such that 
    $$\sum_{i=1}^{n} r_i f_i + s g = 0. $$
    Thus it suffices to compute the kernel
    (syzygies) of the $1 \times (n+1)$ matrix
    $$(f_1, ... ,f_n, g)$$
    and collect the coefficients of $g$, that is,
    the entries of the last row of a matrix
    representing the kernel. 
    Thus in our case we may compute $(I_1:d)$
    by concatenating the matrix for $I_1$
    with the single variable $d$
</p>
<p><code>I1aug = (gens I1) | matrix{{d}}</code></p>
<p><code>augrelations = gens ker I1aug</code></p>
<p>
    There are 3 rows (numbered 0,1,2 !) and
    2 columns, so to extract the last row we
    may do
</p>
<p><code>I21 = submatrix(augrelations, {2}, {0,1})</code></p>
<p>
    But this is not an ``ideal'' properly speaking:
    first of all, it is a matrix, not an ideal,
    and second of all its target is not $R^1$
    but $R(-1)$, the free module of rank 1 with
    generator in degree 1.  We can fix both
    of these problems by
</p>
<p><code>I21 = ideal I21</code></p>
<p>
    This is larger than the original ideal, having
    two quadratic generators instead of a 
    quadric and a cubic, so
    we continue.  Instead of doing the same
    computation again, we introduce the built-in
    command
</p>
<p><code>I22 = I21 : d</code></p>
<p>
    which is again larger than "I21", having
    three quadratic generators. Repeating,
</p>
<p><code>I23 = I22 : d</code></p>
<p>
    we get another ideal with three quadratic
    generators.  It must be the same as {\tt I21},
    but the generators are written differently
    because of the route taken to get it, so
    (being suspicious) we might check with
</p>
<p><code>(gens I23) % (gens I22)</code></p>
<p>
    which returns 0, showing that "I23" is 
    contained in (gives remainder 0 when divided
    by) "I22".  Thus the homogeneous ideal "I2" of 
    the projective closure is equal to "I23"
    (this is the homogeneous ideal of 
    the twisted cubic, already encountered above).
</p>
<p>
    A more perspicuous way of approaching the
    computation of the union of the $(I:d^n)$,
    which is called the saturation of $I$ with
    respect to $d$, and written $(I:d^\infty)$,
    is first to compute a reverse lex Gröbner
    basis.
</p>
<p><code>gens gb I1</code></p>
<p>
    This yields $(a2-bd, abd-cd2, b2d2-acd2)$,
    meaning 
    $$(a^2-bd, abd-cd^2, b^2d^2-acd^2).$$
    We see that the second generator is divisible
    by $d$, and the third is divisible by $d^2$.
    General theory says that we get the right
    answer simply by making these divisions,
    that is, the saturation is
    $$(a^2-cd, ab-cd, b^2-ac),$$
    as previously computed.  The same thing
    can be accomplished in one line by
</p>
<p><code>I2 = divideByVariable(gens gb I1,d)</code></p>
<p>
    This saturation may be found directly in \(\mac\):
</p>
<p><code>saturate(I1, d)</code></p>

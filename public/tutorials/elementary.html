<p>        In this tutorial we introduce a number
        of basic operations using Gröbner bases, and
        at the same time become familiar with a range
        of useful Macaulay2 constructs. The sections are:
        
        A.  First steps; example with a monomial curve
        
        B.  Random regular sequences
        
        C.  Division with remainder
        
        D.  Elimination theory
        
        E.  Quotients and saturation</p>

    <h4>A. First Steps; example with a monomial curve</h4>
<p>        To compute the Gröbner basis of an ideal
        <i>(x<sup>2</sup>y,xy<sup>2</sup>+x<sup>3</sup>)</i> in the polynomial ring in
        four variables we proceed as follows:
        
        Our favorite field</p>
        <code>KK = ZZ/31991</code><br>
<p>        The polynomial ring</p>
        <code>R = KK[x,y,z,w]</code><br>
<p>        and the ideal</p>
        <code>I = ideal(x^2*y,x*y^2+x^3)</code><br>
<p>        now the punch line:</p>
        <code>J = gens gb I</code><br>
<p>        From this we can for example compute the
        codimension, dimension,
        degree, and the whole Hilbert
        function and polynomial.  
        This will be more fun if we work with an
        example having some meaning.  We choose
        to work with the ideal defining the
        rational quartic curve in <i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup></i> given
        parametrically in an affine representation
        by 
        <p align=center><i>t ↦ (t,t<sup>3</sup>,t<sup>4</sup>).</i></p>
        (The reader who doesn&rsquo;t understand this
        terminology may ignore it for the moment,
        and treat the ideal given below as a 
        gift from the gods... .)
        We obtain the ideal by first making the 
        polynomial ring in 4 variables (the
        homogeneous coordinate ring of <i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup></i>)</p>
        <code>R = KK[a..d]</code><br>
<p>        and then using a function <tt>monomialCurveIdeal</tt>, which we shall
        treat for now as a black box</p>
        <code>I = monomialCurveIdeal(R,{1,3,4})</code><br>
<p>        From Macaulay2&rsquo;s point of view, <i>I</i> is an
        ideal, and the codimension of its support
        is 2, while its dimension is 2:</p>
        <code>codim I</code><br>
        <code>dim I</code><br>
<p>        This is the codimension of <i>R/I</i> in <i>R</i> 
        and the dimension of <i>R/I</i>.  We could work with
        the module <i>R/I</i> as well.
        Precision requires writing <i>R<sup>1</sup></i> instead
        of <i>R</i> (<i>R</i> is a ring, and <i>R<sup>1</sup></i> is
        the free module of rank 1 over it)</p>
        <code>codim (R^1/(I*R^1))</code><br>
<p>        We could also extract the generators of
        <i>I</i> (as a matrix) and take the cokernel to
        get the same thing:</p>
        <code>M = coker gens I</code><br>
        <code>codim M</code><br>
        <code>dim M</code><br>
<p>        And similarly for the degree:</p>
        <code>degree I</code><br>
        <code>degree M</code><br>
<p>        As one might expect, the degree of the quartic
        is 4 !
        
        The Hilbert polynomial is obtained by</p>
        <code>hilbertPolynomial M</code><br>
<p>        The term <i><b>P</b><sup>i</sup></i> represents the Hilbert polynomial of
        projective <i>i</i>-space.  This formula tells
        us that the Hilbert polynomial of <i>M</i> is
        <i>H(m) = 4(m+1) - 3 = 4m + 1</i>.  Thus the degree
        is four, the dimension of the projective variety
        which is the support of <i>M</i> is 1 (and so the affine
        dimension is 2),
        and that the (arithmetic) genus is 0 (1 minus the
        constant term, for curves).
        
        The Hilbert series of <i>M</i> (the generating function
        for the dimensions of the graded pieces of <i>M</i>) is</p>
        <code>hilbertSeries M</code><br>
<p>        The indeterminate in this expression is $T.
        
        Another way to get information about
        the module <i>M</i> is to see its free resolution</p>
        <code>Mres = res M</code><br>
<p>        To get more precise information about <tt>Mres</tt>,
        we could do</p>
        <code>betti Mres</code><br>
<p>        The display is chosen for compactness:
        B    total: 1 4 4 1
        B        0: 1 . . .
        B        1: . 1 . .
        B        2: . 3 4 1
        the first line gives the total betti 
        numbers, the same information given when
        we type the resolution.  The remaining
        lines express the degrees of each of the
        generators of the free modules in the
        resolution.  The <i>j</i>th column after the colons
        gives the degrees of generators of the
        <i>j</i>th module(counting from <i>0</i>); 
        an <i>n</i> in the <i>j</i>th column in the
        row headed by &ldquo;<i>d</i>:&rdquo; means that the <i>j</i>th
        free module has <i>n</i> generators of degree
        <i>n+j</i>.  Thus for example in our case, the
        generator of the third (last) free module in the
        resolution has degree <i>3+2=5</i>.</p>

<div>
    <h4>B. Random regular sequences</h4>
<p>        An interesting and illustrative open problem
        is to understand the initial ideal (and 
        the Gröbner basis) of a &ldquo;generic&rdquo; 
        regular sequence.  To study a very simple case
        we take a matrix of 2 random forms 
        in a polynomial ring in
        3 variables:</p>
        <code>R = KK[x,y,z]</code><br>
        <code>F = random(R^1, R^{-2,-3})</code><br>
<p>        makes <i>F</i> into a <i>1 &times;2</i> matrix whose elements
        have degrees <i>2,3</i> (that is, <i>F</i> is a random map
        to the free module <i>R<sup>1</sup></i>, which has its one
        generator in the (default) degree, <i>0</i>, from
        the free module with generators in the listed
        degrees, <i>{2,3}</i>).  We now can compute</p>
        <code>GB = gens gb F</code><br>
        <code>LT = leadTerm gens gb F</code><br>
        <code>betti LT</code><br>
<p>        shows that there are Gröbner basis elements
        of degrees 2,3, and 4.  This result is
        dependent on the monomial order in the ring <i>R</i>;
        for example we could take the lexicographic
        order</p>
        <code>R = KK[x,y,z, MonomialOrder => Lex]</code><br>
<p>        (see <tt>help MonomialOrder</tt> for other possibilities).
        We get </p>
        <code>F = random(R^1, R^{-2,-3})</code><br>
        <code>GB = gens gb F</code><br>
        <code>LT = leadTerm gens gb F</code><br>
        <code>betti LT</code><br>
<p>        and there are Gröbner basis elements of degrees 
        <i>2,3,4,5,6.</i></p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>C. Division With Remainder</h4>
<p>        A major application of Gröbner bases is
        to decide whether an element is in a given
        ideal, and whether two elements reduce to
        the same thing modulo an ideal.  For
        example, everyone knows that the trace
        of a nilpotent matrix is 0. We can produce
        an ideal <i>I</i> that defines the variety <i>X</i> of 
        nilpotent <i>3 &times;3</i> matrices by taking the cube
        of a generic matrix and setting the entries
        equal to zero.  Here&rsquo;s how:</p>
        <code>R = KK[a..i]</code><br>
        <code>M = genericMatrix(R,a,3,3)</code><br>
        <code>N = M^3</code><br>
        <code>I = flatten N</code><br>
<p>        (actually this produces a 1 x 9 matrix of
        of forms, not the ideal: <tt>J = ideal I</tt>;
        the matrix will be more useful to us).
        But the trace is not in <i>I</i>!  This is obvious
        from the fact that the trace has degree <i>1</i>,
        but the polynomials in <i>I</i> are of degree <i>3</i>.
        We could also check by division with
        remainder:</p>
        <code>Tr = trace M </code><br>
        <code>Tr //I  -- the quotient, which is 0</code><br>
        <code>Tr % I  -- the remainder, which is Tr again</code><br>
<p>        (Here <tt>Tr</tt> is an element of <i>R</i>, not a matrix.
        We could do the same thing with a <i>1 &times;1</i> matrix
        with <tt>Tr</tt> as its element.)
        This is of course because the entries of <i>I</i> do
        NOT
        generate the ideal of all forms 
        vanishing on <i>X</i> -- this we may find with
        <tt>J = radical ideal I</tt>,
        (but this takes a while: see the documentation for
        <tt>radical</tt> on a faster way to find this)
        which shows that the radical is generated by
        the trace, the determinant, and the sum of 
        the principal <i>2 &times;2</i> minors, that is, by the
        coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.
        In particular, we can try the powers of the
        radical:</p>
        <code>Tr^2 % I</code><br>
        <code>Tr^3 % I</code><br>
        <code>Tr^4 % I</code><br>
        <code>Tr^5 % I</code><br>
        <code>Tr^6 % I</code><br>
        <code>Tr^7 % I</code><br>
<p>        The seventh power is the first one in the 
        ideal!  (Bernard Mourrain has worked out a
        formula for which power in general.)
        In this case</p>
        <code>Tr^6 // I</code><br>
<p>        is not 0.  It is a matrix that makes the
        following true:</p>
        <code>Tr^6 == I * (Tr^6 // I) + (Tr^6 % I)</code><br>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>D. Elimination Theory</h4>
<p>        Consider the problem of projecting the
        &ldquo;twisted cubic&rdquo;, a curve in <i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup></i> defined
        by the three <i>2 &times;2</i> minors of a certain
        <i>2 &times;3</i> matrix into the plane.  
        Such problems can be solved in a very 
        simple and direct way using Gröbner bases.
        The technique lends itself to many extensions,
        and in its developed form can be used to find
        the closure of the image of any map of 
        affine varieties.  
        
        In this section we shall first give a 
        simple direct treatment of the problem above,
        and then show how to use Macaulay2&rsquo;s 
        general tool to solve the problem.
        We first
        clear the earlier meaning of <tt>x</tt> to make it
        into a subscripted variable</p>
        <code>x = global x</code><br>
<p>        and then set</p>
        <code>R = KK[x_0..x_3] </code><br>
<p>        the homogeneous coordinate ring of <i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup></i>
        and</p>
        <code>M = map(R^2, 3, (i,j)->x_(i+j))</code><br>
        <code>I = gens minors(2,M)</code><br>
<p>        a matrix whose image is 
        the ideal of the twisted cubic.
        As projection center we
        take the point defined by</p>
        <code>pideal = ideal(x_0+x_3, x_1, x_2)</code><br>
<p>        To find the image we must intersect the ideal
        <i>I</i> with the subring generated by the 
        generators of <tt>pideal</tt>.  We make a change of
        variable so that these generators become
        the last three variables in the ring; that
        is, we write the ring as <i>KK[y<sub>0</sub>..y<sub>3</sub>]</i>
        where 
        <p align=center><i>y<sub>0</sub> = x<sub>0</sub>, y<sub>1</sub> = x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>2</sub> = x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>3</sub> = x<sub>0</sub>+x<sub>3</sub></i></p>
        and thus
        <i>x<sub>3</sub> = y<sub>3</sub>-y<sub>0</sub></i>, etc. 
        We want the new ring to have an &ldquo;elimination
        order&rdquo; for the first variable.</p>
        <code>y = global y</code><br>
        <code>S = KK[y_0..y_3,MonomialOrder=> Eliminate 1]</code><br>
<p>        Here is one way to make the substitution</p>
        <code>I1 = substitute(I, matrix{{y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3-y_0}})</code><br>
<p>        The elimination of 1 variable from the 
        matrix of Gröbner basis elements proceeds
        as follows:</p>
        <code>J = selectInSubring(1,gens gb I1)</code><br>
<p>        and gives (a matrix with element)
        the cubic equation of a rational
        curve with one double point in the plane.
        However, we are still in a ring with 4 
        variables, so if we really want a plane
        curve (and not the cone over one) we must
        move to yet another ring:</p>
        <code>S1 = KK[y_1..y_3]</code><br>
        <code>J1 = substitute(J, S1)</code><br>
<p>        This time we didn&rsquo;t have to give so much
        detail to the <tt>substitute</tt> command because of 
        the coincidence of the names of the variables.
        
        Having shown the primitive method, we
        now show a much more flexible and transparent
        one:  we set up a ring map from the polynomial
        ring in <i>3</i> variables (representing the plane)
        to <i>R/I</i>, taking the variables <i>y</i> to the three
        linear forms that define the projection 
        center.  Then we just take the kernel of
        this map!  (&ldquo;Under the hood&rdquo;, 
        Macaulay2 is doing a more refined version
        of the same computation as before.)
        Here is the ring map</p>
        <code>Rbar = R/(ideal I)</code><br>
        <code>f = map(Rbar, S1, matrix(Rbar,{{x_0+x_3, x_1,x_2}}))</code><br>
<p>        and the desired ideal</p>
        <code>J1 = ker f</code><br>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>E. Quotients and saturation</h4>
<p>        Another typical application of 
        Gröbner bases and syzygies is to the
        computation of ideal quotients and 
        saturations.  Again we give an easy example
        that we can treat directly, and then 
        introduce the tool used in Macaulay2 to 
        treat the general case.
        
        If <i>I</i> and <i>J</i> are ideals in a ring <i>R</i>, we define
        <i>(I:J)</i>, the ideal quotient, by 
        <p align=center><i>(I:J) = {f &isin;R &nbsp;|&nbsp;fJ &sub;I}.</i></p>
        
        In our first examples we consider 
        the case where <i>J</i> is 
        generated by a single element <i>g</i>.
        This arises in practice, for example, in the
        problem of homogenizing an ideal.  Suppose
        we consider the affine space curve
        parametrized by
        <i>t ↦ (t,t<sup>2</sup>,t<sup>3</sup>)</i>.  The ideal of polynomials
        vanishing on the curve is easily seen to
        be <i>(b-a<sup>2</sup>, c-a<sup>3</sup>)</i> (where we have taken
        <i>a,b,c</i> as the coordinates of affine space).
        To find the projective closure of the curve
        in <i><b>P</b><sup>3</sup></i>, we must homogenize these equations 
        with respect to a new variable d, getting
        <i>db-a<sup>2</sup>, d<sup>2</sup>c-a<sup>3</sup></i>.  But these forms do NOT
        define the projective closure! In general,
        homogenizing the generators of the ideal <i>I</i> of
        an affine variety one gets an ideal <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> that
        defines the projective closure UP TO
        a component supported on the hyperplane
        at infinity (the hyperplane <i>d=0</i>).  To see
        the ideal of the closure we must remove
        any such components, for example by
        replacing <i>I<sub>1</sub></i> by the union <i>I<sub>2</sub></i> of all the
        ideals <i>(I<sub>1</sub>:d<sup>n</sup>)</i>, where <i>n</i> ranges over positive
        integers.  This is not so hard as it seems:
        First of all, we can successively compute
        the increasing sequence of ideals
        <i>(I<sub>1</sub>:d), (I<sub>1</sub>:d<sup>2</sup>), ...</i> until we get two 
        that are the same; all succeeding ones
        will be equal, so we have found the union.
        A second method involves a special property
        of the reverse lex order, and is much more
        efficient in this case.  We shall illustrate
        both. First we set up the example above:</p>
        <code>R = KK[a,b,c,d]</code><br>
        <code>I1 = ideal(d*b-a^2, d^2*c-a^3)</code><br>
<p>        How to compute the ideal quotient:
        If <i>I</i> is generated by <i>f<sub>1</sub>,...,f<sub>n</sub></i>, we see that
        <i>s&isin;(I:g)</i> iff there are ring elements 
        <i>r<sub>i</sub></i> such that 
        <p align=center><i>&sum;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> r<sub>i</sub> f<sub>i</sub> + s g = 0. </i></p>
        Thus it suffices to compute the kernel
        (syzygies) of the <i>1 &times;(n+1)</i> matrix
        <p align=center><i>(f<sub>1</sub>, ... ,f<sub>n</sub>, g)</i></p>
        and collect the coefficients of <i>g</i>, that is,
        the entries of the last row of a matrix
        representing the kernel. 
        Thus in our case we may compute <i>(I<sub>1</sub>:d)</i>
        by concatenating the matrix for <i>I<sub>1</sub></i>
        with the single variable <i>d</i></p>
        <code>I1aug = (gens I1) | matrix{{d}}</code><br>
        <code>augrelations = gens ker I1aug</code><br>
<p>        There are 3 rows (numbered 0,1,2 !) and
        2 columns, so to extract the last row we
        may do</p>
        <code>I21 = submatrix(augrelations, {2}, {0,1})</code><br>
<p>        But this is not an &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; properly speaking:
        first of all, it is a matrix, not an ideal,
        and second of all its target is not <i>R<sup>1</sup></i>
        but <i>R(-1)</i>, the free module of rank 1 with
        generator in degree 1.  We can fix both
        of these problems by</p>
        <code>I21 = ideal I21</code><br>
<p>        This is larger than the original ideal, having
        two quadratic generators instead of a 
        quadric and a cubic, so
        we continue.  Instead of doing the same
        computation again, we introduce the built-in
        command</p>
        <code>I22 = I21 : d</code><br>
<p>        which is again larger than <tt>I21</tt>, having
        three quadratic generators. Repeating,</p>
        <code>I23 = I22 : d</code><br>
<p>        we get another ideal with three quadratic
        generators.  It must be the same as <tt>I21</tt>,
        but the generators are written differently
        because of the route taken to get it, so
        (being suspicious) we might check with</p>
        <code>(gens I23) % (gens I22)</code><br>
<p>        which returns 0, showing that <tt>I23</tt> is 
        contained in (gives remainder 0 when divided
        by) <tt>I22</tt>.  Thus the homogeneous ideal <tt>I2</tt> of 
        the projective closure is equal to <tt>I23</tt>
        (this is the homogeneous ideal of 
        the twisted cubic, already encountered above).
        
        A more perspicuous way of approaching the
        computation of the union of the <i>(I:d<sup>n</sup>)</i>,
        which is called the saturation of <i>I</i> with
        respect to <i>d</i>, and written <i>(I:d<sup>&infin;</sup>)</i>,
        is first to compute a reverse lex Gröbner
        basis.</p>
        <code>gens gb I1</code><br>
<p>        This yields <tt>(a2-bd, abd-cd2, b2d2-acd2)</tt>,
        meaning 
        <p align=center><i>(a<sup>2</sup>-bd, abd-cd<sup>2</sup>, b<sup>2</sup>d<sup>2</sup>-acd<sup>2</sup>).</i></p>
        We see that the second generator is divisible
        by <i>d</i>, and the third is divisible by <i>d<sup>2</sup></i>.
        General theory says that we get the right
        answer simply by making these divisions,
        that is, the saturation is
        <p align=center><i>(a<sup>2</sup>-cd, ab-cd, b<sup>2</sup>-ac),</i></p>
        as previously computed.  The same thing
        can be accomplished in one line by</p>
        <code>I2 = divideByVariable(gens gb I1,d)</code><br>
<p>        This saturation may be found directly in Macaulay2:</p>
        <code>saturate(I1, d)</code><br>

# My wonderful tutorial (by F. Bar)

## Name of the first lesson in the tutorial

Some text, allowing TeX, and things like ${\tt ring}$.

A blank line in a Text section places the parts in separate paragraphs.
Here is a second line for this paragraph.

```
R = ZZ/32003
```

```
f = i -> i^3
```

The following lines will be placed on one clickable button.

```
g = (x) -> (
    x^2-x-1
    )
```

## Name of the second lesson in the tutorial

Some more text, and perhaps some math like $x^2-x-1$.
Or whatever.

```
S = QQ[a..d]
```
